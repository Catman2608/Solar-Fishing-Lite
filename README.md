# Project Environment Setup Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide walks through setting up Python and all required modules for running the project. The application uses GUI automation, OCR, screen capture, and cross-platform OS features.

---

## 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- **OS**:
  - Windows (fully supported through the AutoHotKey version)
  - macOS (fully supported)
  - Linux (experimental / manual setup only)
- **Administrator/Root access** may be needed for certain system-level operations
- **Internet connection** for downloading packages

---

## 2️⃣ Install Python (macOS and Linux)

### Option A: Using the Official Installer (Recommended)
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and run the installer
3. ✅ **Important**: Check *"Add Python to PATH"* during installation

### Option B: Using Homebrew (macOS only)
```bash
# Install via official website, or with homebrew if using a script:
python -m ensurepip --upgrade  # pip may not be installed by default on macOS
```

### Verify Installation
Open Terminal/Command Prompt and run:
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```
Expected output: `Python 3.8+`

---

## 3️⃣ Install Required Modules (macOS and Linux)

Run this command in order to download the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pywebview numpy mss pytesseract pynput requests opencv-python
```
If the command above fails, try using pip3 instead:
```bash
pip3 install pywebview numpy mss pytesseract pynput requests opencv-python
```

### Complete Package List Reference
| Module | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `webview` | `pip install pywebview` | GUI window creation |
| `numpy` | `pip install numpy` | Numerical operations, image arrays |
| `mss` | `pip install mss` | Screenshot capture (multi-screen support) |
| `pynput` | `pip install pynput` | Keyboard/mouse automation & listening |
| `requests` | `pip install requests` | Discord API calls |

## 4️⃣ Platform-Specific Setup

### 🐧 Linux — Experimental Support

Linux is supported for running from source, but pre-compiled builds may not be available for every distribution.

Additional requirements may be needed:

#### Ubuntu/Debian example:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-tk tesseract-ocr
```

---

## 5️⃣ Verify Installation (macOS and Linux)

Create a test script `test_imports.py`:

```python
import webview, json, os, re, time, sys
from tkinter import messagebox

from pynput import keyboard, mouse
from pynput.keyboard import Controller as KeyboardController
from pynput.mouse import Controller as MouseController, Button

import numpy as np, mss
if sys.platform == "win32":
    import ctypes, wintypes

elif sys.platform == "darwin":
    from Quartz import NSScreen

elif sys.platform.startswith("linux"):
    from Xlib import X, XK, display as Xdisplay

import requests, io

print("✅ All modules imported successfully!")
```

Run it with `python test_imports.py` — no errors means your setup is complete.

---

## 6️⃣ Windows installation guide
Windows doesn't use the Python version; it instead uses another AutoHotKey branch.
Step 1: Install AutoHotKey V1.1 (NOT V2) at https://www.autohotkey.com
Step 2: Double-click the Solar Fishing Lite.ahk file

---

## 7️⃣ Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `_tkinter.TclError: No such file or directory` | Install tkinter: `pip install tkinter` (macOS) or reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked |
| Permission denied on screenshot/capture | Run the script as Administrator (Windows) or with elevated privileges (macOS) |
